# Project Documentation

DEPRECATED: Documentation consolidated into a single file `DOCUMENTATION.md` at the project root.

All content previously maintained in this folder was merged into `DOCUMENTATION.md` to simplify maintenance. Please consult `DOCUMENTATION.md` for the complete and up-to-date documentation.

If you'd like me to remove the `docs/` folder files entirely, confirm and I'll delete them (I will not remove them without your approval).
